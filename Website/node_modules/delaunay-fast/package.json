  "readme": "This is just a quick little implementation of [Delaunay Triangulation][1] in\nJavaScript. It was mostly ported from [Paul Bourke's C implementation][2], but\nI referenced some bits from [another JavaScript implementation][3] and rewrote\na bunch of things in ways more amenable to fast JavaScript execution.\n\nEssentially, you pass Delaunay.triangulate a list of vertices (which should be\na bunch of two-element arrays, representing 2D Euclidean points), and it will\nreturn you a giant array, arranged in triplets, representing triangles by\nindices into the passed array. (This representation is a little bizarre, but\nobject allocation is too slow for this library's [original use case][4]. Yes,\nreally.)\n\nBeware of using vertices that are too close to each other (say, within 0.01 on\neither axis): numerical precision issues may result, causing your mesh to be\ninvalid. (If you encounter this, simply multiply each of your vertices'\npositions by a constant factor.)\n\n[1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation\n[2]: http://paulbourke.net/papers/triangulate/\n[3]: http://www.travellermap.com/tmp/delaunay.htm\n[4]: http://forecast.io/\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nTo the extent possible by law, I have [waived all copyright and related\nor neighboring rights][cc0] to this library.\n\n[cc0]: http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\n\nRelated\n-------\n\n*   [@yahiko00][5] has released a [TypeScript interface][6] that may be useful\n    if you are trying to access this library from TypeScript.\n\n[5]: https://github.com/yahiko00\n[6]: https://github.com/yahiko00/delaunay\n",
